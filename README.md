This code is done for the project of robotics course in the University of Jordan
you can use the solver by picking data points for the manipulator and writing the DH parameters for the manipulator, the solver will check if the data point is inside the manipulator's work space , then it will solve the forward and inverse kinematic problem for each data point using analytical or numarical approach, after finding the solutions for the inverse kinematic proplem, the solver will choose the best soltion that will result in the less effort for the robot, and it will generate splines paths (between data points) that robot will travel through and the solver will make sure that the chosen path satisfy the acceleration and velocity limits.
